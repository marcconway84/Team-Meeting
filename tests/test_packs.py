"""The packs, the build, and the copy of the rules the leaderboard uses.

The game itself runs in the browser and is tested there - worker/test/engine.test.js
checks matching and the clue sheet against every question in every pack, and
worker/test/scoring.test.js checks the scoring. What is left for Python is the part
Python owns: that a pack cannot be malformed, that the page builds with everything
in it, and that the price list the browser is handed is the one the board charges.
